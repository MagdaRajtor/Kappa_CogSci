Results To test these three predictions of the constructive hypothesis , we studied hippocampus ensemble discharge during two distinct task variants of the active place avoidance paradigm (Figure 1A) [14] that resulted in correspondingly distinct hippocampus ensemble discharge patterns [13].

This led Hejnowicz [13,14] to the hypothesis that cell divides with respect to PDGs, a division wall is typically formed in the plane perpendicular to one of PDGs at the site of its formation.					TRUE			
The results of adjusted R2 is equal to 0.307, which means the independent variables could describe approximately 31 percent of the changes on dependent variable and F-value is equal 5.862 with Pvalue =0.036 and this means that there is a linear relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. 3.2.1 The first hypothesis The first hypothesis of this survey investigates whether there is a meaningful relationship between ownership concentration and enterprise value of privatized firms or not as follows, H 0 : There is no meaningful relationship between ownership concentration and enterprise value of privatized firms.

The basic hypothesis of this study, which consists in exploring the possibility of producing biogas with water hyacinth and using it, instead of firewood for cooking, has been proven, as confirmed by certain authors (Chanakya et al., 1993; Kivaisi and Mtila, 1998; Singhal and Rai, 2003; Kumar, 2005).

To further investigate the hypothesis of secondary organic aerosol contributing to Wisconsin episodes (perhaps in aqueous chemical pathways in clouds or fog), OC, EC, and PM2.5 data from 1-in-3 samples from January 2001 to October 2009 were used to calculate OC/EC and OC/PM2.5 ratios.

To investigate this hypothesis , BMMs from intact WT mice were cultured for 7 days with SCs from either PPRT cells 2/2 or control mice in the presence of PTH, a hormone that under these conditions promotes OC formation by targeting SCs.					TRUE	Y	testing	
A number of shortcomings of the historically prevailing dopamine hypothesis –most prominently the suboptimal or lacking clinical response of negative and cognitive symptoms to D2 antagonism and findings of structural brain changes associated with the schizophrenia–inspired the integration of glutamate into a theoretical framework of the disorder [45–47].

The methods used: as a qualitative research, which aims is to know the concept, the followed phases are those of a scientific method [1] including: setting the questions - the working hypotheses are formulated as guiding questions for the present study, that can be found at the beginning of each chapter, being tested during the interview; the documentation – the study of national and international literature regarding the concepts covered by our research; the hypotheses testing - some hypotheses can be tested, others not, so that the conclusion for each of them is approached in terms of confirmation or not, some of them still having no practical support to be confirmed.

Nowadays, for addressing the recognized and realistic issues which originate in the management and analysis of biological data, it incorporates the construction and development of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical methods and hypothesis [1].					TRUE			
This hypothesis is also supported by the generated networks in our pathway analysis (Figure 2B), in which NFkB (presumably under the control of TGFb) is assigned to elicit Ras, PI3K, and MAPK signaling towards actin-mediated responses driving cellular	Y		Y		FALSE	Y		
This hypothesis explains the effect of both E1 inhibition and proteasome inhibition on GAD cleavage, and the results showing no apparent ubiquitination of the enzyme (present work), and the role of calpains [24].	?		?		FALSE	Y		
This hypothesis was further contrasted by Bayly et al. (1992) on the basis of their 2-D compressible hydrodynamic simulations who demonstrated that a spectrum for density fluctuations can arise purely as a result of abondoning a barotropic equation of state without even requiring a magnetic field.

As a consequence we con clude that the null hypothesis (H10) is rejected and there is a relationship of dependency between choosing the Balance Sheet form and the reporting basis, meaning that the accounting standards used determine the preference for one form of Balance Sheet or another.	?		?
